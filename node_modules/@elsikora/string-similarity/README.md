## API

The package contains two methods:

### compareTwoStrings(string1, string2)

Returns a fraction between 0 and 1, which indicates the degree of similarity between the two strings. 0 indicates completely different strings, 1 indicates identical strings. The comparison is case-sensitive.

##### Arguments

1. string1 (string): The first string
2. string2 (string): The second string

Order does not make a difference.

##### Returns

(number): A fraction from 0 to 1, both inclusive. Higher number indicates more similarity.

##### Examples

```javascript
stringSimilarity.compareTwoStrings("healed", "sealed");
// ‚Üí 0.8

stringSimilarity.compareTwoStrings(
  "Olive-green table for sale, in extremely good condition.",
  "For sale: table in very good  condition, olive green in colour."
);
// ‚Üí 0.6060606060606061

stringSimilarity.compareTwoStrings(
  "Olive-green table for sale, in extremely good condition.",
  "For sale: green Subaru Impreza, 210,000 miles"
);
// ‚Üí 0.2558139534883721

stringSimilarity.compareTwoStrings(
  "Olive-green table for sale, in extremely good condition.",
  "Wanted: mountain bike with at least 21 gears."
);
// ‚Üí 0.1411764705882353
```

### findBestMatch(mainString, targetStrings)

Compares `mainString` against each string in `targetStrings`.

##### Arguments

1. mainString (string): The string to match each target string against.
2. targetStrings (Array): Each string in this array will be matched against the main string.

##### Returns

(Object): An object with a `ratings` property, which gives a similarity rating for each target string, a `bestMatch` property, which specifies which target string was most similar to the main string, and a `bestMatchIndex` property, which specifies the index of the bestMatch in the targetStrings array.

##### Examples

```javascript
stringSimilarity.findBestMatch('Olive-green table for sale, in extremely good condition.', [
  'For sale: green Subaru Impreza, 210,000 miles',
  'For sale: table in very good condition, olive green in colour.',
  'Wanted: mountain bike with at least 21 gears.'
]);
// ‚Üí
{ ratings:
   [ { target: 'For sale: green Subaru Impreza, 210,000 miles',
       rating: 0.2558139534883721 },
     { target: 'For sale: table in very good condition, olive green in colour.',
       rating: 0.6060606060606061 },
     { target: 'Wanted: mountain bike with at least 21 gears.',
       rating: 0.1411764705882353 } ],
  bestMatch:
   { target: 'For sale: table in very good condition, olive green in colour.',
     rating: 0.6060606060606061 },
  bestMatchIndex: 1
}
```
